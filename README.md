This simple app is to practice html, css and javascript. It implements the design and functionalities of the calculator in a huawei smartphone Nova 2i.

The project helps me to learn the following topics:
1) Html
2) Css bootstrap grid system
3) javascript - function, and object
4) getting started with responsive design.
